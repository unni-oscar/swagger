Swagger is a specification format for describing REST APS. From this spec, you can create interative documentation, automate test scripts and more. Swagger is also called OpenAPI Specification and its a great tool to Design, Build, Consume and document Restfull API

The heart of Swagger is its specification. The Swagger spec is the rulebook that standardizes API practices (how to define parameters, paths, responses, models, etc). And every other part of Swagger is just a way of appropriating or creating API documentation that works with these rules.

Few good reasons for using swagger

Industry Standard
Swagger is the widely adopted documentation and specification standard for REST Services. it’s already used in real production APIs, so you don’t have to be the beta tester. It also means that the API user has probably already experience with Swagger, which dramatically reduces the learning curve.

Comprehensible for all
Product manegers, partners and potential clients can have input inot the design of your API, because they can see it clearlt mapped out in this friendly UI

Readability
This means that not only can this be shared with your team internally, but the same documenation can be used to automate API-dependent processes.

Designed for REST
Swagger is really easy to use, because it’s a single-purpose tool for documenting REST Services. So most of the complicated things, like security or reusing resource definitions across several methods, are already handled gracefully by the standard.

Adjustable
Make it easy for testing and debugging API Problems

Auto-generate Code: 
You can auto-generate client and server code (interface part) based on the Swagger spec, which makes sure that they are consistent. 

Huge Community: 
There’s a great community around Swagger, so when you face a problem, you can usually just Google the solution.
